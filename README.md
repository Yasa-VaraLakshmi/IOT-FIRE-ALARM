# IOT-FIRE-ALARM

We are going to design a Fire Alarm circuit using a few electrical components like Temperature and Gas sensors using TinkerCad and interface it with Arduino.

TinkerCad circuit simulation software: It is an online simulation software used for circuit design. It has all the electrical components required to built circuits and runs them.
